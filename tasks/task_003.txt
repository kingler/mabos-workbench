# Task ID: 3
# Title: BDI Agent Engine Core Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: critical
# Description: Develop the core Belief-Desire-Intention agent reasoning system with ontology management and agent lifecycle capabilities
# Details:
Implement the complete BDI architecture as specified in the technical requirements. Create agent classes for beliefs, desires, and intentions. Implement goal-oriented planning algorithms. Set up ontology management with Owlready2 and Neo4j integration. Create agent coordination protocols and message-based communication. Implement meta-agent capabilities for system self-optimization.
