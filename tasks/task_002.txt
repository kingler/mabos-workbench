# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Architecture & Schema Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the multi-database architecture including PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis, and Elasticsearch with comprehensive schemas
# Details:
Implement the complete database architecture as specified in the SARD. Set up PostgreSQL with all tables, indexes, and relationships. Configure Neo4j for knowledge graphs and ontologies. Set up Redis for caching and session management. Configure Elasticsearch for search and analytics. Implement database migration scripts and backup procedures.

# Test Strategy:
Test database performance under load. Verify data integrity across all databases. Test backup and recovery procedures. Validate schema compliance with business requirements.
