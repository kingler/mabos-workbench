# Task ID: 7
# Title: LLM Gateway & Multi-Provider Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Build intelligent LLM gateway supporting multiple providers with routing, caching, and failover capabilities
# Details:
Implement LLM gateway service with support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google providers. Create intelligent routing based on task complexity and provider capabilities. Implement response caching with Redis for performance optimization. Set up failover mechanisms and load balancing. Create rate limiting and cost optimization features. Implement request/response logging and monitoring.
