You are tasked with conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of three codebases to create a more efficient MultiAgent Business Operating System using goal-oriented BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) multi-agent system method and technologies. Your analysis should identify where the codebases align, where they diverge, and how we can combine features to create a more efficient system.

You will be provided with five codebase reports. Please analyze them carefully:

<codebase_report_1>
/Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/mabos-workbench/agentdock-mabos-analysis.json,

</codebase_report_1>

<codebase_report_2>
/Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/mabos-workbench/dify-mabos-analysis.json,
</codebase_report_2>

<codebase_report_3>
/Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/mabos-workbench/kestra-kb-analysis.json
</codebase_report_3>

<codebase_report_4>
/Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/mabos-workbench/mabos-standalone-analysis.json
</codebase_report_4>

<codebase_report_5>
/Users/kinglerbercy/Projects/mabos-workbench/suna-analysis.json
</codebase_report_5>


To conduct your analysis, follow these steps:

1. Comparative Analysis:
   a. Identify the main features and functionalities of each codebase.
   b. Compare and contrast the architectural designs, data structures, and algorithms used in each codebase.
   c. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each codebase in terms of efficiency, scalability, and maintainability.

2. Alignment and Divergence:
   a. Identify areas where the codebases align in terms of functionality, design patterns, or implementation approaches.
   b. Highlight significant divergences between the codebases, noting unique features or differing approaches to similar problems.
   c. Analyze the reasons for these alignments and divergences, considering factors such as intended use cases, performance requirements, or development philosophies.

3. Feature Combination:
   a. Propose ways to combine the best features from each codebase to create a more efficient MultiAgent Business Operating System.
   b. Consider how these combined features can enhance the overall system performance, flexibility, and user experience.
   c. Address potential challenges in integrating these features and suggest solutions.

4. Goal-oriented BDI Multi-agent System Integration:
   a. Explain how the goal-oriented BDI multi-agent system method can be applied to the combined features.
   b. Describe how the Belief, Desire, and Intention components of BDI can be implemented in the context of the MultiAgent Business Operating System.
   c. Discuss the potential benefits of using this approach in terms of system autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities.

5. Technologies and Implementation:
   a. Recommend specific technologies or frameworks that could be used to implement the proposed MultiAgent Business Operating System.
   b. Discuss how these technologies align with the BDI multi-agent system approach and support the combined features from the original codebases.

After completing your analysis, present your findings and recommendations in the following format:

<comparative_analysis>
Provide a summary of your comparative analysis, highlighting key similarities and differences between the three codebases.
</comparative_analysis>

<alignments_and_divergences>
List and explain the main alignments and divergences you identified among the codebases.
</alignments_and_divergences>

<feature_combination>
Describe your proposed approach for combining features from the three codebases, explaining how this will create a more efficient MultiAgent Business Operating System.
</feature_combination>

<bdi_integration>
Explain how the goal-oriented BDI multi-agent system method can be applied to the combined features, and discuss the benefits of this approach.
</bdi_integration>

<implementation_recommendations>
Provide recommendations for technologies and implementation strategies to realize the proposed MultiAgent Business Operating System.
</implementation_recommendations>

<conclusion>
Summarize the key points of your analysis and emphasize the potential improvements and benefits of the proposed system.
</conclusion>

Your final output should be a markdown file named `comparative_analysis-report.md` which consist only of the content within these tags however in markdown format headers and lists etc, presenting a clear and comprehensive analysis of the codebases and your recommendations for creating an efficient MultiAgent Business Operating System using the goal-oriented BDI multi-agent system method.
