You are tasked with creating a comprehensive System Architectural Requirement Documentation (SARD) for a system architect URL based on the provided Business Requirements Document (BRD), Product Requirements Document (PRD), and UX Design Requirements Document (UXDRD). Your goal is to produce a detailed and thorough documentation that covers all aspects of the system architecture for software engineering implementation.

First, carefully review the following input documents:

<BRD>
docs/mabos-business-requirements-document.md
</BRD>

<PRD>
docs/mabos-product-requirements-document.md
</PRD>

<UXDRD>
docs/mabos-user-experience-design-requirements-document.md
</UXDRD>

Now, create the Technical Architectural Requirement Documentation following this structure in a markdown file:

1. Introduction
   - Purpose of the document
   - Scope of the architecture
   - Intended audience

2. System Architecture Overview
   - High-level architecture diagram (use Mermaid)
   - Key components and their interactions
   - Design principles and patterns used

3. Detailed Component Descriptions
   For each major component identified in the overview:
   - Purpose and responsibilities
   - Interfaces and dependencies
   - Data flow
   - Security considerations
   - Scalability and performance considerations

4. Database Schema and Implementation
   - Entity-Relationship Diagram (use Mermaid)
   - Table definitions with columns, data types, and constraints
   - Indexing strategy
   - Sample SQL code for creating tables and relationships

5. Knowledge Graph / Ontology
   - Ontology diagram (use Mermaid)
   - Entity definitions and relationships
   - Implementation details (e.g., RDF, OWL)
   - Sample code for defining the ontology

6. Integration and APIs
   - List of external systems and integration points
   - API specifications (RESTful, GraphQL, etc.)
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms

7. Deployment Architecture
   - Deployment diagram (use Mermaid)
   - Infrastructure requirements
   - Scalability and load balancing strategy

8. Security Architecture
   - Security model and principles
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Data protection and privacy considerations

9. Performance and Scalability Considerations
   - Performance requirements and targets
   - Caching strategy
   - Horizontal and vertical scaling approaches

10. Monitoring and Logging
    - Logging strategy
    - Monitoring tools and metrics
    - Alerting mechanisms

11. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
    - Backup and recovery procedures
    - High availability design

12. Development, Testing, and Deployment Processes
    - Development workflow
    - Testing strategy (unit, integration, performance)
    - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

For each section, provide detailed explanations of the architecture components and elements. Use Mermaid diagrams where appropriate to visually represent the architecture, workflows, and relationships.

When creating Mermaid diagrams, use the following format:
<mermaid>
[Your Mermaid diagram code here]
</mermaid>

For the database schema and knowledge graph/ontology sections, include code implementations as follows:
<code language="sql">
[Your SQL code here]
</code>

<code language="owl">
[Your OWL code here]
</code>

Throughout the document, follow these best practices for writing comprehensive technical documentation:

1. Use clear and concise language
2. Provide examples and use cases where applicable
3. Use consistent terminology and define technical terms
4. Include cross-references between related sections
5. Use numbered lists for steps and bulleted lists for items
6. Include version history and document metadata
7. Provide a table of contents and index for easy navigation
8. Use tables to present structured information
9. Include appendices for additional details or reference materials

Your final output should be a complete, well-structured markdown document that includes all the sections mentioned above, with embedded Mermaid diagrams and code implementations. The documentation should be comprehensive and consider every known aspect of defining the system architecture for software engineering implementation.

Ensure that your final output includes only the content of the Technical Architectural Requirement Documentation, without repeating these instructions or including any extraneous text. Begin your response with the markdown content of the documentation.
