You are tasked with creating a new project codebase that combines the best features and practices from multiple existing projects into a single, optimized multi-agent business operating system (MABOS). Your goal is to analyze the provided project codebases, identify their key features and strengths, and then create a new, concise, and elegant application that represents an optimized version of the MABOS concept.

First, review the description of the MABOS standalone project:

<mabos_description>
[text](mabos-standalone-analysis.json)
[text](mabos-standalone-codexray-report.md)

</mabos_description>

Now, you will be provided with multiple project codebases analysis reports to analyze. These codebases are:

<project_codebases_analysis>
[text](agentdock-mabos-analysis.json)
[text](agentdock-mabos-codexray-report.md)
[text](comparative_analysis-report.md)
[text](dify-mabos-analysis.json)
[text](dify-mabos-codexray-report.md)
[text](kestra-kb-analysis.json)
[text](kestra-kb-codexray-report.md)
[text](mabos-standalone-analysis.json)
[text](mabos-standalone-codexray-report.md)
[text](suna-analysis.json)
[text](suna-codexray-report.md)
</project_codebasess_analysis>

For each project codebase:
1. Analyze the code structure, architecture, and design patterns used.
2. Identify the key features and functionalities implemented.
3. Note any unique or particularly efficient implementations.
4. Recognize best practices in code organization, error handling, and optimization.

After analyzing all projects, create a combined list of features and best practices that should be incorporated into the new project. Prioritize features that align with the MABOS concept and contribute to a more efficient and robust system.

Design a new project structure that can accommodate all the identified features while maintaining a clean and modular architecture. Consider how the different components will interact and ensure that the design allows for easy expansion and maintenance.

Implement the combined features in the new project, ensuring that you:
1. Use consistent coding styles and naming conventions.
2. Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
3. Optimize code for performance where possible.
4. Include clear comments and documentation.
5. Ensure all components are well-integrated and work together seamlessly.

Throughout the development process, focus on creating error-free code. Implement unit tests for critical components and conduct thorough testing to identify and resolve any potential issues.

Once you have completed the implementation, provide a summary of the new project, highlighting:
1. The key features incorporated from each original project.
2. Any new or improved functionalities in the combined system.
3. The overall architecture and design choices made.
4. How the new project better represents the MABOS concept compared to the standalone version.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<new_project_summary>
[Provide a comprehensive summary of the new project as outlined above]
</new_project_summary>

<key_features>
[List the key features incorporated from each original project]
</key_features>

<architecture_overview>
[Describe the overall architecture and design of the new project]
</architecture_overview>

<optimization_highlights>
[Highlight any significant optimizations or improvements made]
</optimization_highlights>

<mabos_enhancements>
[Explain how the new project enhances or better represents the MABOS concept]
</mabos_enhancements>

Remember, your final output should only include the content within these in a markdown file in the cwd /docs folder. this file will be use to write a comprehensive BRD and PRD for this project. Do not include any of your analysis process or intermediate steps in the final response.
