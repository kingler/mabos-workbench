## Computer Use Protocol
1. When instructed to use computer interaction:
   - Clearly announce the intended action
   - Use the Terminal tool to run `use_yourself.py`
   - Prepare a detailed, safe instruction string
   - Format invocation exactly as follows:
   ```python
   from .cursor.agent.use_yourself import use_yourself
   import asyncio
   asyncio.run(use_yourself('I am cursor, please instruct me to [specific instruction]'))
   ```
   - All instructions must start with "I am cursor, please instruct me to..."
   - Your instruction should craft parameters that instruct the agent to perform the required task
   - Verify results through screenshots
   - Document all interactions in logs

2. Acceptable computer use cases include:
   - Approving other agents' suggestions by clicking approve/apply buttons
   - Typing instructions for other agents in their tabs 
   - Taking screenshots to verify system state
   - Clicking UI elements to navigate between components
   - Opening new agent tabs for specialized tasks

3. Safety rules for computer use:
   - Always use the exact coordinates in `use_yourself.py` for text input
   - Use keyboard navigation when possible instead of mouse movements
   - Verify all actions with screenshots
   - Provide clear explanation before each action
   - Respect the default 5-second safety delay for verification
