# Multi-Agent System (MAS) Workbench for Business Development and Operations

## Overview

This Multi-Agent System (MAS) Workbench is a sophisticated frontend platform designed for developing complex, goal-oriented, BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) multi-agent systems. It's specifically tailored for business applications, including business development, operations, intelligence, and performance management.

The workbench incorporates advanced features such as:
- Interactive diagram editors for visualizing agent interactions and goals
- Integration with backend services for agent management and communication
- Customizable node types for different agent roles and goals
- Real-time updates and state management

## Key Components

### 1. Diagram Editor

The Diagram Editor allows users to create and manage visual representations of agents, their roles, and their interactions. It supports custom node types for different agent roles and goals.

#### Example: Custom Node for Agent
```typescript:app/components/CustomNodes/AgentNode.tsx
startLine: 33
endLine: 47
```

### 2. Agent Management

The workbench provides components for managing agents, including creating, updating, and deleting agents. It integrates with backend services to fetch and manipulate agent data.

#### Example: Workbench Component
```typescript:app/components/Workbench.tsx
startLine: 1
endLine: 50
```

### 3. Communication

The workbench supports inter-agent communication using a standardized protocol. It also allows for human-agent interaction through natural language processing.

#### Example: Communication Interface
```typescript:app/Model.md
startLine: 7
endLine: 22
```

### 4. Goal Management

Agents can pursue goals autonomously, and the workbench provides tools for defining and managing these goals. It supports goal decomposition and visualization.

#### Example: Goal-Oriented Agent
```typescript:app/Model.md
startLine: 50
endLine: 71
```

### 5. Environment

The workbench represents the environment in which agents operate, including other agents and external systems. It provides real-time updates and state management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mas-workbench.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install

5. Access the application:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the workbench in action.

## Extending the Workbench

To extend the workbench for your specific use case:

1. Define custom node types in `components/CustomNodes/`
2. Create new components for managing agents and goals
3. Integrate with additional backend services as needed
4. Customize the diagram editor to support new types of interactions and visualizations
